This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This is common in asynchronous operations, where the state update might happen after the component renders.

```javascript
// Incorrect
function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name') */}
    </View>
  );
}
```

The problem is that `data` is initially `null`, and the component attempts to read `data.name` before the `fetch` request completes and updates `data`.
